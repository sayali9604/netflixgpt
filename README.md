 if we want to make form in our website formik is good library..to use

 # Authentication 
 for this we need firebase backend
 # Navigation 
 navigate works only in children of app .
 # TMDB API 
 -go to tmdb website 
 -login there 
 -go to api key section find API key there
 -register the app there online

 # why everything happens two times we see in console.
 -this is because strict mode ..if we remove this from our code it will show us once.
 it will happen in our local when we were developing the app.
 this strict mode checks the if there is any inconsistency happen there.
 # Modular coding 
 Breaking the code into small modules.
 # useSelector 
 it is used to fetch data..in our web app.
